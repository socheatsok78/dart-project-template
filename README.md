### What's the point?
- Command-line applications need to do input and output.
- The dart:io library provides I/O functionality.
- The args package helps define and parse command-line arguments.
- A Future object represents a value that will be available at some time - in the future.
- Streams provide a series of asynchronous data events.
- Most input and output requires the use of streams.
